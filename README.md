# Predicting Customer Churn Using LSTM

# Overview
This project involves building a deep learning model using an LSTM network to predict customer churn. The model analyzes customer data and identifies patterns to classify whether a customer is likely to churn.

Features
Preprocesses customer data for training and testing.
Implements an LSTM-based deep learning model using TensorFlow.
Achieves a high accuracy in predicting customer churn.
